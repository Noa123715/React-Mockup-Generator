# React-Mockup-Generator

Welcome to the React Mockup Generator project! This document outlines the tasks and objectives of developing a code generator for JSX (React HTML) components. The purpose of this project is to create a tool that generates "apps" using predefined components, such as headers, text, buttons, tables, and images.

In the first phase, we will develop reusable components and enhance an existing sample application. This involves creating stateless components, defining TypeScript interfaces for component props, applying TailwindCSS classes for styling, and conducting rendering tests. Additionally, we will introduce a new RMGButton component to showcase the capabilities of the sample app.

The second phase involves exploring the use of ChatGPT to generate code mockups by providing specific prompts. We will define prompts instructing ChatGPT to generate desired JSX code snippets and evaluate its capabilities by generating code mockups for predefined designs.

In the final phase, we aim to establish a dynamic code generation service. This service will accept natural language descriptions as input and utilize an AI model to generate JSX code. We will set up a Node.js service, create an API endpoint for processing requests, integrate it securely with the OpenAI API, and format the response to return JSX code
